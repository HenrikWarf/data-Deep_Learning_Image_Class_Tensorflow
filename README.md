# Image Classification - Capstone Project
### Background

As a final project of my Udacity Nanodegree Program I decided to go a bit deeper into Deep Learning and go through an exercise within Image Classification. As Udacity has a prepared project with Dog Breed classification as an option I decided to do my classification project within dog breeds as well. This said. I have not followed the prepared project that Udacity provided but instead structured my own way of doing it.

* Step 1: Load and prepare data
* Step 2: Data Agumentation
* Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds
* Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds - Using Transfer Learning

### The data

The data is downloaded from a Kaggle challenge but originates from Stanford and includes 120 different dog breeds within the over 20.000 images. For my work I will use about half of the available pictures (~10.000).

### My Goals & Motivation

* Get an understanding of Tensorflow as a deep learning library
* Explore different options of data preperation for deep learning with Tensorflow
* Explore different options of data agumentation from deep learning with Tensorflow
* Create a Image Classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch
* Create a Image Classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network with the use of Transfer Learning

### Libraries used 
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* numpy
* os
* tensorflow
* tensorflow.keras.models
* tensorflow.keras.layers
* tensorflow.reqularizers

### Files in repository
* Capstone_Image_Classification_(Final_version).ipynb - Main notebook with all the code written in Python. 
* README.md - this file. Overview description of the project.
* Capstone_Image_Classification_(Final_version).html - Same content as main notebook only in HTML format. 

### Results
* Created a CNN deep learning model using transfer learning and achieved an accuracy of 76.5%  after using transfer learning and  data augmentation.
* Created a custom CNN deep learning model from scratch with an accuracy on the test data of 8.4%
* Have achieved a greater understanding of Tensorflow as a Deep Learning library within many areas of a deep learning pipeline all the way from data preparation and training  to transfer learning and data augmentation. .
* Explored and presented different data preparation options with Tensorflow.
* Explored, tried and presented different options of data augmentation with Tensorflow.
